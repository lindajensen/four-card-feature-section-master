## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about Flexbox, more specifically about the CSS Property -- align-self -- which I had not used before.  

```css
    .inner-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        column-gap: 30px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }

    .box.cyan {
        align-self: center;
    }

    .box.blue {
        align-self: center;
    }
```

### Continued development

I need to keep practicing a mobile-first workflow and also keep using Flexbox. I need to learn more about CSS Grid as well. I also need lo learn more about the CSS Property -- position -- because I definitely do not know enough about that. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with Flexbox and the align-self property.
